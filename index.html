	<h1>Emily Meixell</h1> <!--this is my name-->
	<h2>She/Her</h2>

	<p>My <strong><em>birthday is on Wednesday</em></strong> so that should be fun but also I love being an art major. It is my true passion and I honestly can't imagine my life without art. In my free time, I love to read, write, and sing. I missed being in the classroom but I am honestly still worried for what the future may hold.</p>
